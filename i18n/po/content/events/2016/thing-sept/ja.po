"3D printing technology is becoming ever more affordable and there's no shortage of design tools. However, this "
"workshop is for anyone interested in using an algorithmic approach to fabricate physical objects and do so using a "
"language & toolset, which makes playing with data and geometry truly joyful. Over the two days of this workshop, "
"you'll will learn hands-on some of the endless potential, which procedural generation can bring to the field of "
"digital fabrication. And, you'll not only be able to take home your own 3D printed object, but too learn about "
"important skills and pitfalls to watch out for in your future practice with these technologies."

"It’s a synchronous event, in a syncretist city with syncopated music, about "
"an async language. On February 15th and 16th, 2018, two hundred Clojurists "
"from around the world, like yourselves, will come to the heart of New "
"Orleans to enjoy talks about humanity, business, and code through the lens "
"of Clojure and Functional Programming."

"The topics are different from what we’re used to at other conferences. If "
"Strange Loop is about the confluence of industry and academia, Clojure SYNC "
"is about the connections between our skills, our work, and the history of "
"technology. If you like the PurelyFunctional.tv Newsletter, you’ll love the "
"talks at Clojure SYNC. An explicit goal of the conference is to broaden our "
"perspectives on the history of computing and how it fits into the history of "
"humanity."
